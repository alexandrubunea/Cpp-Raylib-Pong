# Pong made with Raylib in C++

A reproduction of the first game ever made "Pong", this game is built without using any modern engine like Unity or Unreal.
The game is using the Raylib library to handle rendering, collision, the game loop, and the sound.
To play the game is required to use a keyboard. The players will use the keys: W, S, and UP, DOWN to control the paddles.
